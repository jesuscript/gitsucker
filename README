Gitsucker

This is a script to find and rank all people who forked a particular project on GitHub according to the following criteria:

* number of original projects they've authored
* number of ruby or javascript projects they have authored or forked
* number of orignal or forked projects they have

API requests to github may, depending on your network bandwidth and latency, take quite a bit of time to complete, so this script attempts to run the requests concurrently. The number of concurrent requests is limited (option -n). You can set the limit to whatever, but generally I would not recommend running more than 10 threads at the same time in order to avoid potential I/O issues.

The output produced is a CSV file - feel free to import this into Excell and sort in any direction you like :)



Installation:

The script uses the py-github module for hanling API. You can install that by cloning it's repository:

git clone https://github.com/dustin/py-github.git github

... and installing it on your system:

cd github
sudo python setup.py install



Usage example:

python gitsucker.py -n 5 py-github

This will attempt to get the data for all users who forked py-github and will run up to 5 concurrent API requests at any time.



Known issues:

* Sometimes the API returns 403 Forbidden on certain requests. I'm not entirelly sure as for why this happens, but I've noticed that this isn't deterministic either: the same request may respond with data and sometimes - with an error. It would require more time to investigate this fully. However, this only tends to happen with larger projects (e.g. backbone). Failed request for a user is handled nicely: the script just ignores that user (acknowledging the failure). If the repo search or the repo network request fails - well, there isn't much you can do about it. Just run the program again...
